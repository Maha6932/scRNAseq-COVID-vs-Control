## üìå Project Overview

This repository contains a **comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis** comparing lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient with healthy control tissue. The analysis reveals **pathological cellular stress responses and immune dysfunction** characteristic of severe COVID-19, providing molecular insights into **why some patients develop life-threatening disease**.

Rather than showcasing protective immunity, this dataset uncovers **stress-dominated signatures, immune exhaustion, and epithelial dysfunction** that underlie severe COVID-19 pathology.

## üß™ Dataset Summary

* High-quality scRNA-seq dataset with:

  * **\~20 distinct cell clusters** (respiratory epithelium, immune, stromal)
  * **Low mitochondrial gene expression (0-4%)**
  * **0‚Äì5000+ genes per cell**, **0‚Äì20,000+ molecules per cell**
* Comprehensive annotation:

  * Alveolar (AT1, AT2), airway epithelial, endothelial, fibroblasts
  * CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells, macrophages, dendritic cells

## üîç Key Findings

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Universal Cellular Stress

* **HSP90AA1** upregulated across all cell types
* Additional heat shock proteins (HSPA1A, HSPH1) prominent
* Indicates **crisis-level stress responses** over protective immunity

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Immune Exhaustion Patterns

* CD4+ and CD8+ T cells: hyperactivation signatures without effective immunity
* B cells: minimal activation (immune suppression)
* Macrophages: inflammatory signatures without resolution

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Epithelial and Structural Cell Dysfunction

* AT2 cells: disruption in surfactant production and repair
* Airway epithelium: compromised barrier genes
* Endothelium: signatures of vascular leak and damage

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Pathway Insights

* **KEGG Enrichment** highlights:

  * Protein processing in ER
  * PI3K-Akt signaling
  * Antigen processing and presentation
* Pathways suggest **maladaptive stress responses** over immune protection

### Novel Contributions Highlight:
‚úÖ Universal stress response as a marker for severe COVID-19.
‚úÖ Cell-type-specific dysfunction hierarchy explaining severe disease outcomes.
‚úÖ Identification of tissue-specific immune exhaustion in severe COVID-19 lungs.
‚úÖ Data suggests immune failure, not hyperactivation, in severe COVID-19.

   * Volcano plots for each cell type

4. **Pathway Enrichment**:

   * KEGG enrichment on up/downregulated genes (`clusterProfiler`)
   * Dot plot and barplot visualization

5. **Visualization**:

   * UMAP plots
   * Volcano plots
   * KEGG pathway enrichment plots

This paper contextualizes immune exhaustion in COVID-19, complementing our findings of stress-dominated responses and immune dysfunction at the single-cell level in lung tissue.

üìå This project complements Mohammed et al. (2022), which reviewed systemic immune exhaustion in COVID-19. By analyzing single-cell lung tissue, we demonstrate how severe COVID-19 involves cell-type-specific stress responses, immune dysfunction, and impaired repair, aligning with their findings but providing tissue-level, single-cell resolution insights. This connection strengthens our understanding of severe COVID-19 as a disease of immune exhaustion and cellular crisis, identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for intervention.
